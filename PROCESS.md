# Interactions of the Team
- For the roles of the team, we will all take turns each sprint to be either the product owner or scrum master
- The rest of us will have our regular roles and tasks to complete for the sprint 
- We plan to divide up the team into a possible backend, database, and frontend group to make the work flow more efficiently
- Sprints will consist of 2 week time periods where each team member will have tasks to complete that will take up the required hours of work
- We will plan to meet every thrusday at 6 pm to get togther as a team and discuss to complete tasks, update where we are and ask any questions if need be.
