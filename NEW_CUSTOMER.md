# Processing and Configuring New Customers
When first interacting with our website, customers should create a SyllaBye account so that they can access any syllabi they create later. 
This gives them ownership of the documents, granting them read and write access. 
Customers can access different tabs on the SyllaBye website that allows them to:
- Learn about the site and its functions
- Contact the team or make suggestions
- Input information and generate a syllabus
