If you are a student with a disability who would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please speak with the Learning Access Coordinator at the Center for Academic Success and Enrichment (CASE). Please make an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing learningaccess@lewisu.edu. Since accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class. It is not necessary to disclose the nature of your disability to your instructor.

                                Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level. Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the Provost makes the final decision.

                                Guided by its Catholic and Lasallian heritage, Lewis University is firmly committed to fostering a campus atmosphere that is permeated by its Mission values of Fidelity, Wisdom, Knowledge, Justice, and Association. Accordingly, we have declared the University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity. The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to each other. To learn more about the Sanctified Zone, please visit: http://www.lewisu.edu/sanctified zone<br><br>
                                
                                As a Sanctified Zone, Lewis University affirms the importance of diverse spiritual and value-based identities, worldviews, and expressions, including the observance of religious and cultural traditions. To learn more about the rich diversity of spiritual and cultural holidays celebrated within the Lewis community, please see the Interfaith Calendar. Please note that this calendar is not a designation of spiritual and cultural holidays officially recognized or observed by Lewis University; rather, it is intended as an educational resource for the Lewis community.<br><br>
                                
                                Lewis University is committed to inclusion “together and by association” on our campus and in our classrooms. At the beginning of the semester, you should carefully review this course syllabus and requirements. If you have religious or cultural observances that reasonably conflict with attendance or submission of assignments in this class, please let the instructor know as soon as possible so that alternative arrangements may be discussed at the instructor’s discretion.

                                Students at Lewis University are entitled to personal safety. Our Catholic and Lasallian tradition views every person as created in the image of God, full of dignity and worth. All community members are expected to behave in a way that respects others' rights to control their sexual behavior and bodily integrity. The University takes seriously any incidents of sexual misconduct — including but not limited to sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual intercourse, non-consensual sexual contact and sexual exploitation. To learn more about our comprehensive Sexual Misconduct Policy, find out how to report an incident, or access on and off campus resources, please visit the LU Cares website at www.lewisu.edu/LUCares.

Lewis University policy requires me to share certain information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct with the Title IX Coordinator. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. Information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond, take appropriate measures, and provide resources.<br><br>

For those who may have experienced sexual violence, harassment, dating violence, or stalking, there are no-cost resources available to provide assistance. This support also extends to the individuals' associates. The timeframe in which the violence occurred is not a factor in accessing these resources.
