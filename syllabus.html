Please make an appointment by calling 815-836-5593 or emailing learningaccess@lewisu.edu. Since accommodations require early planning and are not provided retroactively, it is recommended that you make your request prior to or during the first week of class.

                                Scholastic integrity lies at the heart of Lewis University. Plagiarism, collusion and other forms of cheating or scholastic dishonesty are incompatible with the principles of the University. Students engaging in such activities are subject to loss of credit and expulsion from the University. Cases involving academic dishonesty are initially considered and determined at the instructor level. If the student is not satisfied with the instructor’s explanation, the student may appeal at the department/program level. Appeal of the department /program decision must be made to the Dean of the college/school. The Dean reviews the appeal and makes the final decision in all cases except those in which suspension or expulsion is recommended, and in these cases the Provost makes the final decision.

Accordingly, we have declared the University campus to be a Sanctified Zone, a place and a people United in Diversity. The active promotion of diversity and the opposition to all forms of prejudice and bias are a powerful and healing expression of our desire to be Signs of Faith (Signum Fidei) to each other.

To learn more about the rich diversity of spiritual and cultural holidays celebrated within the Lewis community, please see the Interfaith Calendar.

                                Lewis University is committed to inclusion “together and by association” on our campus and in our classrooms. At the beginning of the semester, you should carefully review this course syllabus and requirements. If you have religious or cultural observances that reasonably conflict with attendance or submission of assignments in this class, please let the instructor know as soon as possible so that alternative arrangements may be discussed at the instructor’s discretion.
