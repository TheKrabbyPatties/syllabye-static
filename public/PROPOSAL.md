### **KrabbyPatties MVP Group Proposal**

#### **Definition of MVP**

In software development, the concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plays a crucial role in the process of bringing a product to market efficiently and effectively. The MVP is defined as the most basic version of a product that still provides value to the end user. It incorporates just enough features to satisfy early adopters and gather feedback for future improvements. This approach is commonly utilized in Agile development, where the focus is on delivering functional software in small, iterative cycles, allowing teams to quickly respond to user needs and market changes.

The importance of an MVP lies in its ability to minimize wasted time and resources by focusing only on the essential features needed to make the product viable in the hands of users. By doing so, developers can obtain valuable insights into what features users truly want and how they interact with the product. As Eric Ries, a well-known advocate of the Lean Startup methodology, puts it, an MVP allows teams to acquire “the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”

#### **Key Features of Our MVP**

The core idea behind an MVP is to create a functional product that can be tested in real-world scenarios by actual users. However, the product does not need to be fully polished or feature-complete. Instead, it should focus on delivering the most essential functionality that provides value to the user. For our project, SyllaBye, which is a syllabus creation tool for teachers, the MVP would include the basic feature of creating a syllabus. Teachers would use drop-down selections, fill-in-the-blank options, and checkboxes to simplify the creation of syllabi.

Another important feature of SyllaBye would be the ability to export the created syllabi as a PDF. Teachers need access to a PDF version of their syllabi, which they can either post virtually or print for their classes. These two features—the creation of syllabi and the ability to export them—are the most critical components of the MVP for our product. With this, our team will be able to receive feedback from some early users and further improve the product.

#### **Tools and Technologies Used in MVP Development**

In the development of an MVP, teams often rely on a variety of tools and technologies to build and deploy the product quickly. In the case of SyllaBye, the team uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON for the front-end development. HTML and CSS are used to structure and style the website, while JavaScript is employed to create interactive elements such as drop-downs, checkboxes, and other inputs.

Additionally, the team may use libraries such as html2pdf.js to enable PDF generation directly from the website. GitHub is used for version control, allowing the team to track changes to the codebase and collaborate more effectively. For hosting the application, the team could leverage cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure, which provides scalable infrastructure for web applications.

#### **Future Ideas**

One feature that can improve the quality of SyllaBye is the ability to automatically populate the document with information that is required by the school or university. For example, teachers may be required to include the school’s mission statement, information about academic integrity and grade appeal policies, violence prevention and mandatory reporting, student health and wellness, or more. These can be included and updated through the site. These are just a few examples that were drawn from various syllabi supplied by Lewis University faculty (mandatory information will vary from university to university).

To further enhance the functionality of SyllaBye, the team plans to integrate Google Firebase for storing syllabi and managing user authentication. Firebase is a popular backend-as-a-service platform that offers tools for database management, authentication, and cloud storage. This would make it ideal for rapidly developing web applications without the need to manage complex server infrastructure.

Finally, the team hopes to implement responsive design by learning and using Bootstrap, a front-end framework that simplifies the process of creating websites that work on a variety of screen sizes, from phones to tablets to desktop computers. This would make the product more accessible to teachers who may want to create syllabi on different devices.

#### **Conclusion**

The concept of a Minimum Viable Product is a fundamental approach in modern software development that allows teams to deliver a basic yet functional product with the least amount of effort while still providing value to users. By focusing on essential features, development teams can release a product quickly, gather user feedback, and iterate on the product to improve its functionality and user satisfaction. SyllaBye’s MVP focuses on the core features of creating syllabi and exporting them as PDFs, while additional features such as user accounts and cloud storage are planned for future iterations. By using a variety of tools and technologies, the team can rapidly develop and deploy our MVP, ensuring that it meets the needs of teachers while allowing for continuous improvement based on user feedback. The iterative nature of MVP development ensures that the product evolves in a way that aligns with user expectations and delivers increasing value over time.
