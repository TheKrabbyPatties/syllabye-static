# Repository Setup

Our current system involves using a GitHub repository that our entire team can access, with a separate repository for the static site (`syllabye-static`) and server site (`syllabye-server`) within our organization called **TheKrabbyPatties**.

## Hosting

We are currently using **Microsoft Azure** for both our server site and our client site.

The site addresses can be found below in the links:

- **Server site:** [syllabye-server](https://syllabye-server.azurewebsites.net)
- **Client site:** [thankful-mud-0f7336110.5.azurestaticapps.net](https://thankful-mud-0f7336110.5.azurestaticapps.net)

## Deployment Process

For deployment, we have a testing branch called `main` and a separate production branch for the final changes before they get pushed to our product site. Each team member should:

1. Work on their tasks within their local repositories on their computers and test locally.
2. Push it to the test environment to test it.
3. Finally, the product owner of the group should spend time with the team to review the changes to ensure that they work before releasing them into the production environment.
